# Installing and Configuring Command Access to the ArgoCD Graphical Interface in Kubernetes Cluster k3d

## Prerequisites

- k3d installed on your local machine
- kubectl installed on your local machine

## Installation

1. Create a k3d cluster by running the following command:
   
   ```
   k3d cluster create argocd
   ```

2. Wait for the ArgoCD deployment to complete.

3. To access the ArgoCD web interface, run the following command to expose the service:

   ```
   kubectl port-forward svc/my-argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
   ```

5. Open a web browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8080`. You should now be able to access the ArgoCD graphical interface.

## Configuring Command Access

1. Install the ArgoCD command-line tool by running the following command in your terminal:

 
 ```
curl -sSL -o argocd-linux-amd64 https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest/download/argocd-linux-amd64
sudo install -m 555 argocd-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/argocd
rm argocd-linux-amd64
```  


2. Once the installation is complete, configure the ArgoCD command-line tool to connect to your ArgoCD server by running the following command:

   ```
   argocd login localhost:8080 --insecure --username <ARGOCD_USERNAME> --password <ARGOCD_PASSWORD>
   ```

   Replace `<ARGOCD_USERNAME>` and `<ARGOCD_PASSWORD>` with your ArgoCD credentials.

3. You should now have command-line access to your ArgoCD server. You can use the `argocd` command to perform various tasks, such as syncing applications or viewing their status.
